View&Selection;sketch
select is uniquely done by right button (how about double click of left button??? or mid button?)

1 Arcball: 
translate, rotate, scale (View mode, nothing selected: right button,left button,mid button scroll)
done

2 Creation: 

selection of plane (View mode, right button)
done

translate of plane (View mode, selected: left button)
done


sketching of cross sections (sketch mode, left button)
done

selection of cross sections (then modify (global&local) or delete) (view mode, right button)

3 Others:

if nothing selected,judge the type of the sketching curve to decide the mode

Deformation:
rotate reference plane (View mode, plane selected,left button)
scale reference plane  (View mode, plane selected, mid button scroll)
sketching handle curve or point (sketch mode, object selected, left button)
sketching deformed handle curve or point (sketch mode, left button, handle curve exist, plane selected;set default selected plane)
sketching ROI (circle or sketch) (sketch mode, object selected, shortcut key may be needed)

Extrusion,Tunneling:
sketching closed curve (sketch mode, object selected, left button)
rotate reference plane (view mode, plane selected, left button (up down/left right to decide rotate direction))
scale reference plane (view mode, plane selected, mid button scroll)
sketching trajectory (sketch mode, left button, plane selected, closed curve exist, set default selected plane)


Cutting:
sketching cutting curve (sketch mode, object selected, left button)
